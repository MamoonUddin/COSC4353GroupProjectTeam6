# FuelMe Server

---

### To run the server: 
run ```npm start``` in the terminal    
The server uses nodemon for testing so the server restarts any time there are changes made to files in the server folder  
  
The server also uses environment variables for things like port numbers. To configure them, create a .env file in this folder.

### Environment Variables
```PORT``` Port for server to listen
